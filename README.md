The iOS weather app provides real-time weather updates for the user’s current location or any location they search for. Built using Swift, it leverages the CoreLocation framework to access the user’s location, then fetches and displays weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI).

**Key Features:**

**Current Weather and Forecasts:** Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with intuitive icons.

**Search for Locations:** Allows users to enter a city name to get weather data for any location worldwide.

 **User Interface:** Designed with UIKit or SwiftUI to ensure a smooth, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience.
    
 **Location-Based Updates:** Automatically updates weather information based on the user’s current location.
    
   **Error Handling**: Handles cases where location access is denied or network issues arise, providing meaningful alerts to the user.
